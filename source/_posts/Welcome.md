Hey there. Welcome to DanJTech.com.

This is my personal web page. I mostly use it to write about movies or complain about tech.

This site was built on Hexo under Node.js, and runs through CloudFlare onto Google App Engine. Turns out you can create web content and not pay anyone for it.

I'll be posting documentation on it soon.
